<h2 align="center">About me</h2>
<p align="center">
  <samp>I am a seasoned Cybersecurity Engineer with over a decade of experience in safeguarding digital assets and ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information systems. My journey in the cybersecurity domain spans more than 10 years, during which I have honed my skills in threat modeling, vulnerability management, incident response, and secure coding practices. My expertise is complemented by 7 years of experience as a Software Engineer, providing me with a strong foundation in software development, which is instrumental in understanding and mitigating security vulnerabilities at the code level. Throughout my career, I have been committed to staying ahead of emerging threats and evolving my strategies to protect against them. My hands-on experience with a wide range of security tools, coupled with my deep understanding of software engineering principles, allows me to design robust security architectures and implement effective defense mechanisms. I am passionate about helping organizations navigate the complex landscape of cybersecurity, ensuring that their systems are resilient against attacks, and their data remains secure. My approach is rooted in continuous learning, collaboration, and a relentless pursuit of excellence in every project I undertake.
